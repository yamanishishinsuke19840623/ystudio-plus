"""chapters.py - YouTube chapters from a timestamped transcript.

    python3 chapters.py transcript.srt            # or .vtt / whisper .json
    python3 chapters.py transcript.srt --target 8 --json

Prints a description block you can paste straight under a video. YouTube's own rules, enforced here
rather than assumed: the list must start at 00:00, needs at least three entries, and each chapter
must be at least 10 seconds long. A block that breaks any of those silently does not become
chapters, which is why this checks instead of trusting.

Boundaries come from the gaps - the pauses you actually took between sections - scored by how long
the pause was and how much the vocabulary changes across it. It is a first draft you retitle, not a
summariser.
