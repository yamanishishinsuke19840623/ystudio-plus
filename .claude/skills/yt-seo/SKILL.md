# yt-seo

Search is a smaller lever than packaging and a bigger one than people think for evergreen videos.
For a video aimed at the subscriber feed, say so and spend the effort on `/yt-package` instead.

## Before you write

1. Read `.claude/youtube/voice.md` in this repo (fall back to `~/.claude/youtube/voice.md`) if it exists. Treat any line still marked `UNKNOWN` as unknown - never fill it in yourself. That is the user's voice profile: how they talk
   on camera, the words they never use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it
   does not exist, ask for **three of their own videos**, read or transcribe them, infer the voice,
   and write the file. A script in the wrong voice is worse than no script, because they have to
   read it out loud.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## The description

- **The first two lines are the only ones anyone reads.** They show above "...more" and they are
  the search snippet. Say what the video gives them, in the words they would have typed.
- Then the link or the resource, if there is one, so it is above the fold.
- Then chapters (`/yt-chapters` writes them).
- Then the long version: what is covered, who it is for, what it assumes.

## Tags, honestly

Tags are a weak signal and YouTube has said so. Use them for disambiguation - spellings, the tool
names, the abbreviations people actually type - and stop. Fifteen is plenty. A wall of tags is not
a strategy and stuffing unrelated ones is against the terms.

## The query test

Before handing anything over, write the three search queries this video should win, and check the
title and first two description lines contain the words in those queries. If they do not, the
problem is the title, not the description.

## 日本語チャンネルで使うとき

- ユーザーが日本語なら、出力（台本・タイトル・返信・説明）も日本語で書く。
- FACT（確認できる事実）とIDEA・PLAN（構想）を分けて扱う。数字・実績・固有名詞・肩書きは推測で補わず、不明なら `[FACT:要確認]` と書くか本人に聞く。
- 道具ごとの日本語対応状況は `.claude/skills/README.md` を参照。`hookscore.py` は日本語では未校正なので、点数を根拠に判断しない。

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
