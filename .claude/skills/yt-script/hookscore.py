"""hookscore.py - score a YouTube hook before you waste a take on it.

Five properties, 0-100 each, and a verdict that is 60% the mean and 40% the weakest one. The
weakest-link weighting is deliberate: a hook with four strong properties and one dead one is a hook
that leaks at the dead one, and averaging hides that.

    python3 hookscore.py hooks.txt            # one hook per line, ranked
    python3 hookscore.py --hook "one line"    # score a single hook
    python3 hookscore.py --json hooks.txt     # machine-readable

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT TELL YOU. Measured against 74 real short-form hooks (first 15 seconds of
auto-captions, top-8 and bottom-8 by views across five channels): it separates deliberately bad
hooks from real ones well, and it separates a creator's own hits from their own misses barely at
all. Treat a low score as a reason to look again, never a high score as a promise.
