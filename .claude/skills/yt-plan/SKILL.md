  Plan a week or a month of YouTube uploads - what to post, when, and in
  what order, sized to the creator's actual capacity. Use for "plan my
  week", "content calendar", "what should I post", "I have no idea what to
  make next".

# yt-plan

A plan that does not fit the week is a list of regrets. Ask two questions before writing anything:
**how many hours do you actually have**, and **what is already half-made**.

## Before you write

1. Read `.claude/youtube/voice.md` in this repo (fall back to `~/.claude/youtube/voice.md`) if it exists. Treat any line still marked `UNKNOWN` as unknown - never fill it in yourself. That is the user's voice profile: how they talk
   on camera, the words they never use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it
   does not exist, ask for **three of their own videos**, read or transcribe them, infer the voice,
   and write the file. A script in the wrong voice is worse than no script, because they have to
   read it out loud.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## The shape of a week

- **One anchor.** The video the week is for. It gets the most time and it goes out on the day the
  channel's own analytics say is best - ask for that, do not assume Tuesday.
- **One cheap one.** Built from something that exists: a clip, a reaction, a follow-up to the
  comment that got the most replies last week.
- **Shorts from the anchor.** Three, cut from the long video, not written separately. `/yt-shorts`
  finds them.

Three uploads on a seven-day week, not seven. A plan that posts daily is not a plan anyone
recognises, and the empty days are what make the filled ones survive a bad week.

## What to hand back

A table: day, format, working title, the one sentence it promises, and what already exists for it.
Then the honest line at the bottom - how many hours this costs, and what to drop first if the week
goes wrong.

## 日本語チャンネルで使うとき

- ユーザーが日本語なら、出力（台本・タイトル・返信・説明）も日本語で書く。
- FACT（確認できる事実）とIDEA・PLAN（構想）を分けて扱う。数字・実績・固有名詞・肩書きは推測で補わず、不明なら `[FACT:要確認]` と書くか本人に聞く。
- 道具ごとの日本語対応状況は `.claude/skills/README.md` を参照。`hookscore.py` は日本語では未校正なので、点数を根拠に判断しない。

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
